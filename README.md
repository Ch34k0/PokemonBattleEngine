# PokemonBattleEngine

A C# library that can emulate Pokémon battles.

The library comes with a client and server, so it is possible to host a battle server and have clients matchmake into it and battle each other.
The engine only emulates as if it were Pokémon B2W2 versions, so there will not be features included after generation 5.
